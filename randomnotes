*structures of interior design*
Immortality, anthropomorphism household gods. Reinstated with up-to-date nostalgia, and thus, “furniture too get a second chance to exist, and pass from a naive utility into cultural baroque.

Space: a bed is a bed. A chair is a chair but you can never say a tree is a tree because it’s connected to the soil. And a squirrel is not simply just a squirrel, but a moving being with no specific functions. 

Trees, animals, stones...they are interrelated once they exists. But not beds, furniture, objects. Maybe because they are manufactured. And there are no innate relationships between each other. As Baudrillard says: “a bed is a be, a chair is a chair, and there is no relationship between them so long as each serves only the functions it is supposed to serve. And without such relationships there can be no space.” 

Objects as media, as tools, as the agents to purposes. 

For the true technological problem is the need for a convergence of functions within a single structure feature, not the need for a compromise between conflicting requirements. 
From abstract to concrete. 
Every transition from a system to another, better-integrated system, every commutation within an already structured system, every functional synthesis, precipitates the emergence of meaning, an objective pertinence that is independent of the individuals who are destined to put it into operation.
